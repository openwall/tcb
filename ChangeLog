	* pam_tcb/support.c (_set_ctrl): Request automatic prefix only if
	libcrypt really implements it.
	In some specific, but unusual, build-time configurations of libxcrypt
	the CRYPT_GENSALT_IMPLEMENTS_DEFAULT_PREFIX feature-test macro is
	defined to 0, which means libxcrypt does not provide a best-choice
	default prefix.

	* libs/Makefile: Apply proper soname to libnss_tcb.so.2.

	libnss_tcb: Drop unneeded LIBNSL from linked libraries.

	tcb_unconvert: print error diagnostics if the final chown fails.
	* progs/tcb_unconvert.c (main): Print error diagnostics in an unlikely
	case of an error returned by the final chown invocation.  This does
	not affect the exit status of tcb_unconvert, though, since the final

2018-07-07  Dmitry V. Levin  <ldv at owl.openwall.com>

	pam_tcb: change the default prefix from $2y$ to $2b$ to be friendlier
	to OpenBSD.
	This does not affect builds with libxcrypt >= 4.1.0 that provides
	CRYPT_GENSALT_IMPLEMENTS_DEFAULT_PREFIX feature test macro.
	* pam_tcb/support.c (_set_ctrl)
	[!CRYPT_GENSALT_IMPLEMENTS_DEFAULT_PREFIX]: Replace "$2y$"
	with "$2b$".
	* pam_tcb/pam_tcb.8 (prefix): Likewise.

2018-06-26  Dmitry V. Levin  <ldv at owl.openwall.com>

	pam_tcb: request automatic prefix if libcrypt implements it.
	In libxcrypt, starting with version 4.0.0, supplying a null pointer
	as the "prefix" argument to crypt_gensalt_ra function will cause it
	to select the best available hash function.
	Starting with version 4.1.0, libxcrypt provides
	CRYPT_GENSALT_IMPLEMENTS_DEFAULT_PREFIX macro to test the availability
	of this feature at build time.
	* pam_tcb/support.c (_set_ctrl)
	[CRYPT_GENSALT_IMPLEMENTS_DEFAULT_PREFIX]: When
	pam_unix_param.crypt_prefix is NULL, do not reset it to the pam_tcb
	default value.
	* pam_tcb/pam_tcb.8: Document this.

	pam_tcb: request automatic entropy if libcrypt implements it.
	In libxcrypt, starting with version 4.0.0, supplying a null pointer
	as the "rbytes" argument to crypt_gensalt_ra function will cause it
	to acquire random bytes from the operating system.
	Starting with version 4.1.0, libxcrypt provides
	CRYPT_GENSALT_IMPLEMENTS_AUTO_ENTROPY macro to test the availability
	of this feature at build time.
	* pam_tcb/support.c (do_crypt)
	[CRYPT_GENSALT_IMPLEMENTS_AUTO_ENTROPY]: Invoke crypt_gensalt_ra
	with null "rbytes" and zero "nrbytes" arguments.

2018-05-31  Dmitry V. Levin  <ldv at owl.openwall.com>

	pam_tcb: use pam_get_authtok(3) instead of _unix_read_password.
	This follows the change in pam_unix implemented in Linux-PAM
	commit Linux-PAM-1.3.0~5.
	pam_get_authtok(3) is available in OpenPAM since 2002-04-08
	and in Linux-PAM since 2008-12-03.
	As pam_get_authtok(3) does not support not_set_pass option,
	the support for this not much useful option is dropped.
	Instead pam_tcb gets a proper support for authtok_type= option.
	* pam_tcb/pam_tcb.8 (not_set_pass): Remove.
	(authtok_type): New option.
	* pam_tcb/pam_unix_auth.c (DATA_AUTHTOK): Remove unused macro.
	(pam_sm_authenticate): Use pam_get_authtok instead of
	_unix_read_password.
	* pam_tcb/pam_unix_passwd.c (DATA_OLD_AUTHTOK, DATA_NEW_AUTHTOK):
	Remove unused macros.
	(do_setpass): Remove "fromwhat" argument.
	(unix_prelim): Use pam_get_authtok instead of _unix_read_password.
	(pam_sm_chauthtok): Remove UNIX_NOT_SET_PASS support.
	* pam_tcb/support.c (data_cleanup, _unix_read_password): Remove
	unused functions.
	(unix_bools): Replace "not_set_pass" with "use_first_pass" and
	"try_first_pass".
	(parse_opt): Remove manual handling of "use_first_pass" and
	"try_first_pass".
	(_set_ctrl): Replace "authtok_usage=" with "authtok_type=" in
	the_cmdline_opts.  Remove manual handling of "authtok_usage=".
	* pam_tcb/support.h (UNIX_USE_FIRST_PASS, UNIX_TRY_FIRST_PASS,
	UNIX_AUTHTOK_TYPE): New enum constants.
	(PROMPT_PASS, PROMPT_OLDPASS, PROMPT_NEWPASS1, PROMPT_NEWPASS2,
	MESSAGE_MISTYPED): Remove unused macros.
	(UNIX_NOT_SET_PASS, USE_NONE, USE_TRY, USE_FORCED): Remove unused
	enum constants.
	(struct pam_unix_params): Remove unused authtok_usage field.
	(_unix_read_password): Remove unused prototype.

2018-05-22  Dmitry V. Levin  <ldv at owl.openwall.com>

	pam_tcb: drop obsolete NIS/NIS+ support.
	The GNU C library, starting with version 2.26, deprecated libnsl.
	As result, pam_tcb no longer builds with modern versions of glibc
	configured without --enable-obsolete-nsl option.
	While glibc recommends to use replacement implementations based on
	TIRPC, it's time to get rid of obsolete NIS/NIS+ support altogether.
	* pam_tcb/yppasswd.h: Remove.
	* pam_tcb/yppasswd_xdr.c: Likewise.
	* pam_tcb/Makefile: Do not link with -lnsl.
	(LIBSRC): Remove yppasswd_xdr.c.
	* pam_tcb/pam_tcb.8: Remove references to NIS+.
	* pam_tcb/pam_unix_passwd.c: Remove NIS/NIS+ support.
	* pam_tcb/support.c: Likewise.
	* pam_tcb/support.h: Likewise.
	* progs/tcb_convert.8: Remove references to nis and nisplus.

2012-05-24  Dmitry V. Levin  <ldv at owl.openwall.com>

	pam_tcb: Implement i18n support.
	Linux-PAM starting with release 0.81 implements i18n support using
	gettext.  This change extends i18n support to pam_tcb.
	The i18n support is not enabled by default, define both ENABLE_NLS and
	NLS_PACKAGE macros to enable it.  When NLS_PACKAGE macro is defined to
	"Linux-PAM", pam_tcb will re-use translated messages from Linux-PAM.
	* pam_tcb/support.h: Mark all messages for translation.  Pass through
	dgettext all messages marked for translation when both ENABLE_NLS and
	NLS_PACKAGE macros are defined.

2011-07-17  Solar Designer  <solar at owl.openwall.com>

	* tcb.spec: 1.1, "Requires: glibc-crypt_blowfish >= 1.2".

	* pam_tcb/support.c (_set_ctrl), pam_tcb/pam_tcb.8: changed the default
	hash encoding prefix from "$2a$" to "$2y$" (requires crypt_blowfish 1.2
	or newer).

2010-06-07  Dmitry V. Levin  <ldv at owl.openwall.com>

	* tcb.spec: 1.0.6.

	* libs/libtcb.c (tcb_is_suspect): Drop faulty check for sparse files.
	It was based on a wrong assumption that st_blksize indicates the size
	of allocated blocks.  Also, the notion of sparse files does not apply
	to filesystems with compression turned on.
	The purpose of this check was to prevent some DoS attacks on root
	invoking user management tools and on services doing authentication.
	On a system with tcb shadow files, if group shadow access is somehow
	compromised, those files may be directly written to by their
	corresponding users as well as made sparse, which is what made this
	check somewhat desirable, but it was insufficient and problematic.
	Bug reported by Jim Darby <jim at jimbocorp.uklinux.net>.

	Decrease the size of tcb_privs structure allocated in .data segment
	from 256K to a two dozen bytes by moving a groups array to .bss segment.
	* include/tcb.h (TCB_NGROUPS): Set to fixed value 1024 to reduce a waste
	of address space.  The former value NGROUPS_MAX is immensely large
	nowdays, and root privileged processes are not expected to have so large
	list of supplementary groups anyway.
	(struct tcb_privs): Move the groups array outside the structure.
	* libs/libtcb.c (glob_grplist): New static groups array.
	(tcb_drop_priv_r): Set errno in case of invalid use.
	(glob_privs, tcb_drop_priv_r, tcb_drop_priv): Update for the change of
	tcb_privs structure.
	* libs/nss.c (tcb_safe_open): Likewise.

	* tcb.spec: 1.0.4.
	* LICENSE: Update copyright for 2010 year.

2010-01-20  Dmitry V. Levin  <ldv at owl.openwall.com>

	* libs/libtcb.c (tcb_drop_priv_r): Fix potential grpbuf buffer
	overflow.  This function is expected to return -1 if the buffer in
	tcb_privs structure is not sufficiently large to store all
	supplementary groups, but it didn't.  It treated 1st argument of
	getgroups(2) as the size of buffer in bytes, but according to specs it
	should be set to the size of buffer in items that can be stored there.
	To reproduce the bug, one has to build tcb with NGROUPS_MAX value
	lesser than the value defined in /proc/sys/kernel/ngroups_max, and set
	an appropriate (greater than NGROUPS_MAX) number of supplementary
	groups for the calling process.  There doesn't appear to be any
	untrusted user input involved.  Thus, this bug doesn't have to be
	treated as a security issue.
