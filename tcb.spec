%description
The tcb package consists of three components: pam_tcb, libnss_tcb, and
libtcb.  pam_tcb is a PAM module which supersedes pam_unix and pam_pwdb.
It also implements the tcb password shadowing scheme (see tcb(5) for
details).  The tcb scheme allows many core system utilities (passwd(1)
being the primary example) to operate with little privilege.  libnss_tcb
is the accompanying NSS module.  libtcb contains code shared by the
PAM and NSS modules and is also used by programs from the shadow-utils
package.

%changelog
* Mon Jan 11 2021 Solar Designer <solar-at-owl.openwall.com> 1.2-owl1
- 1.2 release with Dmitry's post-1.1.9.1 cleanups implemented in mid-2020 and
described in ChangeLog, most notably:
+ tcb_chkpwd: remove the last remaining piece of NIS+ support.

* Sat Jul 07 2018 Dmitry V. Levin <ldv-at-owl.openwall.com> 1.1.9.1-owl1
- pam_tcb:
+ Implemented i18n support which is off by default, it can be enabled by
defining both ENABLE_NLS and NLS_PACKAGE macros.
+ Dropped obsolete NIS/NIS+ support.
+ Dropped support for not_set_pass option, introduced authtok_type= option
instead, following the change in pam_unix implemented in Linux-PAM-1.3.0.
+ Synced password expiration messages with Linux-PAM-1.4.0.
+ Changed crypt_gensalt_ra invocation to use default entropy and hash encoding
prefix provided by libcrypt runtime when libxcrypt >= 4.1.0 is used for build.
+ Changed the default hash encoding prefix from $2y$ to $2b$.

* Mon Jun 30 2014 (GalaxyMaster) <galaxy-at-owl.openwall.com> 1.1-owl2
- Removed the deprecated PreReq tag.

* Sun Jul 17 2011 Solar Designer <solar-at-owl.openwall.com> 1.1-owl1
- Changed the default hash encoding prefix from "$2a$" to "$2y$" (requires
crypt_blowfish 1.2 or newer).

* Mon Jun 07 2010 Dmitry V. Levin <ldv-at-owl.openwall.com> 1.0.6-owl1

* Wed Feb 10 2010 Dmitry V. Levin <ldv-at-owl.openwall.com> 1.0.4-owl1
- Fixed potential grpbuf buffer overflow in tcb_drop_priv_r().  There
doesn't appear to be any untrusted user input involved, so this bug
doesn't have to be treated as a security issue.

Pawe≈Ç Hajdan.

* Fri Apr 03 2009 Dmitry V. Levin <ldv-at-owl.openwall.com> 1.0.3-owl1

closing file opened for writing.  Reported by Ermanno Scaglione.

* Tue Oct 31 2006 Dmitry V. Levin <ldv-at-owl.openwall.com> 1.0.2-owl1
- In the PAM module and tcb_chkpwd helper, fixed memory leaks reported
by Alexander Kanevskiy.

* Sat May 06 2006 Dmitry V. Levin <ldv-at-owl.openwall.com> 1.0.1-owl1
- In the PAM module, hardened pam_sm_open_session() to fail for unknown users.

* Wed Dec 28 2005 Dmitry V. Levin <ldv-at-owl.openwall.com> 1.0-owl1
- Fixed potential NULL dereferences in the PAM module password handling.

- Updated conversation code to use pam_prompt.

* Tue Aug 23 2005 Dmitry V. Levin <ldv-at-owl.openwall.com> 0.9.9-owl1
- Restricted list of global symbols exported by the library,
NSS and PAM modules.
- In the PAM module, implemented "openlog" option and disabled
openlog/closelog calls for each logging function invocation,
according to new convention introduced in pam-0.80-owl1.
- Packaged pam_pwdb.so symlink in addition to pam_unix.so.
- Packaged %_libexecdir/chkpwd directory.

we're setting the correct permissions via a trigger on shadow-utils.
- Cleaned up the spec.

for package installation.

* Fri Apr 18 2003 Solar Designer <solar-at-owl.openwall.com> 0.9.8.5-owl1
- Use bold face for component names in .SH NAME, but avoid *roff commands

- Don't include the /sbin/chkpwd.d directory in this package as it's
provided by our pam package.
- Use a trigger on shadow-utils for possibly creating and making use of
group shadow.  This makes no difference on Owl as either the group is
provided by owl-etc (on new installs) or groupadd is already available
when this package is installed, but may be useful on hybrid systems.
